name: nix-agent
description: Operate on this machine's NixOS or Home Manager configuration with the nix-agent MCP tools (build, diff, switch, generations, eval_config, locate_option, check). Use when changing packages, options, or modules; diagnosing a failed build or switch; rolling back a generation; or asking what the live config currently resolves to. Requires the nix-agent MCP server (usually alongside mcp-nixos).

# Nix Agent

## Overview

`nix-agent` MCP tools do NOT read or write files. They build, diff, switch,
and manage generations (the operational core), and evaluate, locate, and
check the live config (introspection), handing every result back as a
compact JSON envelope. Read the envelope: it already holds what you would
otherwise re-fetch by hand.

Division of labor:
- **Your native tools** (Read/Edit/Write) edit `.nix` files.
- **`mcp-nixos`** discovers packages and options (what exists, what it means).
- **`nix-agent`** operates on the user's actual configuration (what their machine resolves, whether it builds, what a switch would change).

Default is apply: after a config change, `diff()` then `switch()` without
waiting. Wait only when the user asked to preview or check, not activate.

## Use MCP tools, not shell, for covered operations

Shelling out for operations below re-pays the context cost this server
exists to remove (raw `nix eval` on `environment.systemPackages` is ~13 KB
the size guard collapses to ~400 bytes). Reach for Bash only for what has
no tool: formatting (`nix fmt`), file edits, and remote-target deploys
(`--target-host`, `--use-remote-sudo`), which privileged tools reject by
design.

| Instead of shell | Call |
|---|---|
| `nixos-rebuild switch/boot/test`, `home-manager switch` (local) | `switch()` |
| `nix build ...toplevel`, `nix build ...activationPackage` | `build()` |
| `nixos-rebuild dry-activate` (local) | `check("dry-activate")` |
| `nix eval <config attr>` | `eval_config(attr)` (batch lists in one call) |
| grepping the tree for where an option is set | `locate_option(attr)` |
| `statix` / `deadnix` directly | `check("lint")` |
| `nvd diff` / `nix store diff-closures` | `diff()` |
| `nix log <drv>` after a failed build | read `failed_derivation.log_tail` |
| `systemctl --failed` after a switch | read `summary.health` |

## Tool Surface

Seven tools in two tiers. All auto-resolve the target when `flake_uri` is
omitted and echo back what they resolved and ran (`resolved_target` and
`command`, or `commands` for `check("lint")`).

Operational core:
- `build(flake_uri?, mode?)`: build the closure, no activation. A failed
  build carries `failed_derivation`.
- `diff(flake_uri?, mode?)`: what a switch would change (adds/removes/
  version bumps), plus a structured `packages` object when it parses.
  Include this in the reply and switch unless the user asked only to
  preview or check.
- `switch(flake_uri?, mode?, validate?, full_log?)`: activate. Records
  `rollback_generation`, returns a `summary` (units changed, derivations
  built, `packages` vs the rollback generation, `health`), and trims the
  log to a tail on success. `validate=True` gates on `check("dry-build")`.
  Remote refs and pin mismatches exit as `remote_ref_rejected` /
  `target_locked` before sudo or dry-build. `.` / `./` resolve to the
  pin when `$NIX_AGENT_FLAKE` is set. Newly failed units after
  activation are `status: "degraded"`; report `summary.health` and roll
  back unless the user asked to leave those units failed. Privileged
  argv uses `sudo -n`.
- `generations(action="list"|"rollback", mode?, generation?)`: list or
  roll back. NixOS list entries include `path` when the profile link
  exists. After `switch`, call
  `generations(action="rollback", generation=<rollback_generation or id>)`.
  Bare `generations(action="rollback")` is previous-generation only.
  Unknown ids return `unknown_generation` and run no command.

Config introspection:
- `eval_config(attr, flake_uri?, mode?)`: final merged value of any
  config attribute on THIS machine, after all modules/overlays.
  `mcp-nixos` says what an option means; this says what it is. Pass a
  **list** for `attr` to evaluate many in one call (per-attr `results`).
  All attrs ok or mixed → `ok` (failures in `results`); every attr
  failed → `failed` with `first_error` from the first failed entry that
  has one. Values above ~2 KB degrade to attr names / length / a head
  slice, marked `truncated: true`. A missing hostname attr falls back to
  a unique flake host or returns `unknown_host` with `hosts`. In NixOS
  mode, a missing option is retried as `home-manager.users.<user>.<attr>`
  (`hm_rewritten: true`).
- `locate_option(attr, flake_uri?, mode?)`: which file sets an option,
  as `declarations` and `definitions` (`{file, value}` per file). Earns
  its slot as that which-file answer, not as a cap (measured
  `environment.systemPackages` is 24 KB → 20 KB). Use this instead of
  grepping the tree. `status` is `not_an_option` for plain config values
  (use `eval_config` there). For integrated HM, spell the attr
  `home-manager.users.<user>.<attr>` with `mode="nixos"`; if you pass
  the unprefixed attr, the tool retries that spelling (`hm_rewritten`).
  Missing hostname → `unknown_host` with `hosts`.
- `check(level, flake_uri?, mode?)`: validation ladder, fast to slow:
  `"lint"` (statix + deadnix, structured `findings`), `"dry-build"`,
  `"dry-activate"` (NixOS only). Dry-activate uses the same remote/pin
  classifier as `switch` and attaches `privilege` on sudo auth failure.

Formatting is not a tool: format edited files with the flake's own
formatter (`nix fmt`, or `nixfmt` on the files) via your Bash tool. Repo
onboarding is the `nix-agent inspect-flake` CLI subcommand, not a tool; the
`nix-agent-init` skill drives it.

## Picking `mode` (read before any HM change)

`mode` defaults to `"nixos"`. Do NOT reflexively switch to
`"home-manager"` just because the task touches Home Manager options.
That is the most common way to operate on the wrong config.

- **Integrated HM** (wired in as a NixOS module via
  `home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager` + `home-manager.users.*`):
  no separate `home-manager switch`. HM is built and activated as part
  of the system closure, so use `mode="nixos"` (the default) and
  `switch` the whole system. The common laptop/desktop layout.
- **Standalone HM** (its own flake exposing `homeConfigurations.*`,
  applied with `home-manager switch`): use `mode="home-manager"`.

If both a NixOS flake and a standalone `~/.config/home-manager` flake
exist on the machine, the standalone one is often vestigial. Confirm
which is actually active (`eval_config` against each, or check what the
running generation was built from) before mutating. When in doubt,
`mode="nixos"` is the safer guess.

For nonstandard or multi-flake layouts, do not rely on auto-resolution:
set `NIX_AGENT_FLAKE` once (or `NIX_AGENT_HM_FLAKE` for standalone HM,
which falls back to `NIX_AGENT_FLAKE`), or pass an explicit `flake_uri`
like `/home/you/nixos#host`. Either pins the target exactly.

**Wrong-host symptom:** `unknown_host` lists `hosts` from the flake. A
`failed` envelope whose `first_error` names a missing
`nixosConfigurations."<hostname>"` means auto-resolution could not
recover; pass an explicit `flake_uri` (`.../repo#realhost`) or
`$NIX_AGENT_FLAKE`, not by retrying the same hostname.

## Workflow

1. Discovery (if needed): query `mcp-nixos` for packages/options;
   `eval_config` for what the machine currently resolves; `locate_option`
   for which file to open.
2. Edit `.nix` files with your native file tools.
3. Format with the flake's formatter (`nix fmt`, or `nixfmt` on the edited files) via Bash, then `check("lint")`: fix findings worth fixing.
4. `check("dry-build")`: catches eval/build errors cheaply.
5. `diff()`: include the changeset in the reply and switch unless the
   user asked only to preview or check.
6. `switch()`: report the result and `rollback_generation`. Keep that
   value. `status: "degraded"` means activation succeeded but units
   newly failed — report `summary.health` and roll back unless the user
   asked to leave those units failed.
7. On failure at any step: read `first_error`, then `error_detail`, then
   `failed_derivation.log_tail`; fix and retry. `status: "preflight_failed"`
   means `switch(validate=True)` never activated — fix the nested
   `preflight` dry-build, do not retry activation. A `privilege` field
   means sudo auth failed, not a Nix error. `unknown_generation`,
   `unknown_host`, `target_locked`, and `remote_ref_rejected` are early
   exits: no command ran. On regret after a switch:
   `generations(action="rollback", generation=<rollback_generation or id>)`.
   Bare `generations(action="rollback")` is previous-generation only,
   and is only the right default when nothing else has switched since.

Steps 3 through 5 are judgment calls, not gates. For a trivial change,
going straight to `switch` is fine.

## Token discipline: the envelope is the interface

This server pre-digests Nix's firehose. An agent that re-runs `nix log`
or `systemctl` after every operation throws that away. Read the fields;
do not re-fetch.

- **On failure, read three fields in order and stop.** `first_error` is
  the actionable line. `error_detail` is `{message, file, line, column,
  trace}` when Nix emitted an eval error: a direct file:line:column edit
  target. `failed_derivation.log_tail` is the failing builder's log,
  already fetched. Do NOT run `nix log` or re-run with `full_log=True`
  unless these fields are absent.
- **After a switch, read `summary`, do not re-probe.** `status: "degraded"`
  means units `newly_failed`; treat that as a problem, not success, and
  roll back with
  `generations(action="rollback", generation=<rollback_generation>)`
  unless the user asked to leave those units failed.
  `summary.health` reports units `newly_failed`/`resolved`/`still_failed` with journal
  tails for the first five newly failed units; `summary.packages` reports changes
  vs the rollback generation. These replace running `systemctl --failed`
  or a second `diff()`.
- **Batch attr checks.** `eval_config([...])` answers N questions in one
  call. Mixed results stay `ok` with failures in `results`; if every
  attr failed, top-level `status` is `failed` with `first_error` from
  the first failed entry that has one. A `truncated: true` value means
  eval a child attr for the part you need, NOT retry for full output.
- **`locate_option` before grepping.** It answers "which file sets this"
  in one call; a tree-wide grep does not. That is why it has a slot, not
  because it caps a firehose (24 KB → 20 KB on
  `environment.systemPackages`).
- **Byte accounting is off the envelope.** `raw_bytes` / `returned_bytes`
  live in the usage log (`NIX_AGENT_USAGE_LOG=1`, then `nix-agent usage`),
  not on the tool response. Do not look for them in MCP results.
- **Escape hatches are deliberate last resorts.** `full_log=True` and the
  raw `output` field exist for the rare case the trimmed view genuinely
  lacks what you need; reaching for them by default defeats the server.

## Onboarding a repo

First time in an unfamiliar config? Run `/nix-agent-init`: it runs
`nix-agent inspect-flake` once and generates `AGENT_MAP.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
(+ an `AGENTS.md` symlink), and `.mcp.json` from the observed facts, never
boilerplate.

## Hard Rules

- Prefer the MCP tools over shell for every covered operation in the map
above. Do not shell out to `nixos-rebuild`, `nix build`, `nix eval`,
`statix`/`deadnix`, `nvd`, or `nix store diff-closures` when a tool covers
it; a hook may block such commands and tell you which tool to call instead.
- Never write secret payloads into config files; reference secrets via
sops-nix/agenix and only edit references.
- Never call `switch` when the user asked only to check or preview;
  `diff` is the preview. Otherwise the default is apply: switch after
  `diff()` without waiting.
- `status: "degraded"` means activation succeeded but units newly
  failed; report `summary.health` and roll back unless the user asked
  to leave those units failed.
- Host allowlists cannot see `flake_uri`. Privileged tools reject remote
  refs and honor `$NIX_AGENT_FLAKE` / `$NIX_AGENT_HM_FLAKE` as an
  anti-footgun (the HM lock does not fall back to the NixOS pin). Do not
  treat the pin as a security boundary. Sudoers must be narrowed to that
  directory. Default install is unprompted activation plus passwordless
  sudo for this flake. Do not re-ask for confirmation. Lower trust
  (host prompts, sudo password) only if the user asked.
- After `switch`, undo with
  `generations(action="rollback", generation=<rollback_generation>)`.
  Bare rollback is previous-only.
